# Asteroids-5000

This Unity project demonstrates best coding practices and advanced architectural solutions.

Key features:

-Game logic is extracted into plain C# classes and separated from monobehaviour presentations where applicable.
-Assembly definitions for logic modules separation.
-Zenject(Extenject) for dependency injection.
-Extenject’s SignalBus for communication.
-Custom Physics for movement and collisions.
-MVVM pattern for player’s UI with UniRx Reactive Properties.
-Universal Object Pool with prewarm and max amount restriction functionality for different kinds of objects.
-UniTask instead of synchronous coroutines.
-Strategy pattern for user input, supporting Keyboard & Mouse, touchscreen and x-box type gamepad.
-Custom virtual controls for mobile devices.
-Newtonsoft.json for loading information from json configuration files.
-Immutable Data Transfer Object with factory method for game saves.
-Multi-module Universal Weapon System for player, supporting a wide range of configuration variants.
-Following SOLID principles and C# coding standards.
-Utilizing Interfaces, Inheritance and Abstract classes.
-Patterns used: Strategy, Factory, Object pool, Mediator, Consumer, SignalBus, MVVM.
-Firebase analytics.
-Google Admob for adaptive banners and interstitial ads.
